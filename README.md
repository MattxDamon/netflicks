a tribute to the almighty Netflix

Thanks to gilesvangruisen for the youtube player. Also the scroll view here was based off a tutorial by Michael Briscoe from RW.

Things to add: authentication, friends and friends favorite shows, and more. It would be sweet to keep track of which episode you are on for each of your shows, and it would be nice to have a compelte list of shows.

Unfortunately, Netflix shut down their API: http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/16/netflix-api/ <- boooo netflix, boo

Had a lot of fun making this. If you have any ideas, criticism, advice, please let me know!
