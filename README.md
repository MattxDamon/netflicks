a tribute to the almighty Netflix

Browse a few titles, add to favorites, read my corny comments, watch trailers, or check out Wiki articles.

Thanks to gilesvangruisen for the youtube player. Also the scroll view here was based off a tutorial by Michael Briscoe from RW.

Things to add: authentication, friends, friends favorite shows, and more. It would be sweet to keep track of which episode users are on for each of their shows, and it would be nice to have a complete list of shows that are on Netflix.

Unfortunately, Netflix shut down their API: http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/16/netflix-api/ <- boooo netflix, boo

Had a lot of fun making this. If you have any ideas, criticism, advice, please let me know!
